# Snake Game
A retro Snake game built with vanilla JS. The game has two selectable themes that can be changed during gameplay. A score, local highscore and move counter are used to track gameplay.

## Live Preview

The game is live [here](https://lewisdev94.github.io/snakegame/), hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Technologies

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Completed Improvements
- Move counter only goes up when a new direction is selected
- Added a pastel theme
- You will no longer lose if you try to move into the direction of your snake head, only if you hit the body
- The apple will disappear from the screen if it is touching the 'gameover' overlay

## Future Improvements
- Refactor theme changing code to be less bloated
- User selectable themes with a colour picker tool
- Highscore submit to a database
- Mobile onscreen buttons and media queries for a full mobile experience. (Proof of concept partial code already in place)
- Sound with mute option
