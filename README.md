A retro Snake game built with vanilla JS. 

## Live Preview

The game is live [here](https://snake.lewisdev.me).

## Technologies

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Current Features

- Two selectable themes
- A score, local highscore and move counter

## Completed Improvements
- Changed the interval time so that the game gets harder quicker
- Move counter only goes up when a new direction is selected
- Added a pastel theme
- You will no longer lose if you try to move into the direction of your snake head, only if you hit the body
- The apple will disappear from the screen if it is touching the 'gameover' overlay

## Future Improvements
- Refactor theme changing code to be less bloated
- Comment code throughout
- User selectable themes with a colour picker tool
- Highscore submit to a database
- Mobile onscreen buttons and media queries for a full mobile experience. (Proof of concept partial code already in place)
- Sound with mute option
